# Image-classification-and-similarity-detection

Motivation :

The aim of this project is to detect and extract the object in an
image, classify the object into one of the existing object classes and
detect similarity with the list of sample images. An objectâ€™s spatial,
textural, and contextual properties are all being considered in classification
and similarity detection.
